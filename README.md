## 🎯 Project Purpose

TETRIZZ was created as an open-source learning project with a clear objective:

- To serve as a practical guide for developers who want to understand how HTML5 Canvas works in real-world game development.
- To demonstrate how powerful **pure HTML and Vanilla JavaScript** can be without relying on external frameworks or game engines.
- To improve my own software engineering skills by building a complete modular game architecture from scratch.
- To design a clean, maintainable, and expandable codebase that others can study and learn from.

This project intentionally avoids libraries and focuses entirely on low-level rendering, state management, and game logic.
